      <h3><strong>About me</strong></h3>
      <p>Hi, I'm <strong><span style="color:rgb(251, 139, 64)">Mekinsie</span></strong>. Nice to meet you.</p>
      <img src="me.jpg" alt="An image of me."> 
      <p>I am a currently a student at Epicodus in the Ruby and React full-stack program. Having a growth mindset and perseverance are qualities I strongly value. I am looking for opportunities to work in a tech environment that pushes me to learn and challenge myself. I have developed strong interpersonal skills through my experience as a trainer and associate at ZoomCare and through working in teams at Epicodus. Prior to becoming a student at Epicodus, I was heavily involved in the healthcare industry. This non-traditional background allows me to bring a unique skillset and perspective to the tech world.</p>
      <p>A little more about me:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Regularly hikes to experience the joy of the outdoors</li>
        <li>Classically trained in piano</li>
        <li>Avid reader of fiction</li>
        <li>Addiction to productivity videos on Youtube</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><Strong>Background</Strong></h3>
      <p>
        Before working in the healthcare industry, I had a strong background in design. Photography and product design were my main focuses before switching my major to Human Physiology. I found that coding can be a combination of the sciences and design, both of which I am passionate about. This discovery has led me to pursue a career path in software engineering.
