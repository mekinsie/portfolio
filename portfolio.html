    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>Hi, I'm Mekinsie. Nice to meet you.</p>
    <p>I am a currently a student at Epicodus in the Ruby and React full-stack program. Having a growth mindset and perseverance are qualities I strongly value. I am looking for opportunities to work in a tech environment that pushes me to learn and challenge myself. 
    <br><br>I have developed strong interpersonal skills through my experience as a trainer and associate at ZoomCare and through working in teams at Epicodus. Prior to becoming a student at Epicodus, I was heavily involved in the healthcare industry. This non-traditional background allows me to bring a unique skillset and perspective to the tech world.  </p>
    <p>A little more about me:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Regularly hikes to experience the joy of the outdoors</li>
      <li>Classically trained in piano</li>
      <li>Avid reader of fiction</li>
      <li>Addiction to productivity videos on Youtube</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
